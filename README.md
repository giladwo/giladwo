Hi there! <br/>
I'm a math and computer science student at Technion.

Easily excited about
- :technologist: programming languages & paradigms
- :penguin: free libre software
- :thinking: logic
- :heavy_multiplication_x: abstract algebra, category theory, homotopy type theory
- :robot: frc


Have some experience with c, c++, elm. <br/>
Playing around with haskell, rescript, julia. <br/>
Would love to get up to speed with any of the above or rust, idris, racket, clojure, ocaml, f#, scala. <br/>
... although most of my experience is with python & java :shushing_face:.
